### Booking form updates backend to show time_slot requested.
* Frontend: fetch request with patch method in booking form component. Send only time_slot id and status of requested
* Backend time_slot controller update action for status. 



## Todo
* Duplicate and modify booking form for other services. This form will have drop down menu of services (not private sessions) instead of time_slots. Only goes to formspree, does not need to go to backend.
*Style drop down menus so option fit correctly in menu space.
* Add testimonial scaffold, admin resource, serializer, controller actions.
* Add testimonial component.
* Add photos
